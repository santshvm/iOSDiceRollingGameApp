A dice roller iOS app where users can click a button to roll a dice. 

##  Synopsis

Diceee is an iOS application that allows users to roll a dice on the click of the 'ROLL' button. Basically what the application does is - it detects user interaction and responds to it appropriately by generating random dice images from an array of dice image literals. The User-Interface is very clean and simple. There are two UIImageViews that display single images of dice, each representing  player - 1 and player - 2. There is a UIBUtton named 'ROLL' at the bottom below the dice images that executes the custom code in response to user interactions generating ramdom dice images from an array of dice image literals.

The user can click the ROLL button any number of times to generate random dice images and get to decide who's the winner among player - 1 and player - 2 depending upon the number on the dice that is generated on the click of the button. 

## Motivation
As a newbie in iOS development I believe one should learn as one builds which is why I try to build something using the knowledge I acquire after watching coding tutorials. 
This mini project was created as a code-along project, following the tutorials and instructor of a [Famous iOS App Dev Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). The project was cloned from an existing [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/appbrewery/Dicee-iOS13) and all the functionality was added thereafter. 

# Getting Started 
In order to get started, fork the project and clone it to your local machine. In order to open the project and in oder to run it, you will need to have the latest Apple developer tools installed (Xcode).

# Key Learnings 

* Cloning existing Xcode project from GitHub
* Designing the user-interface using interface builder in Xcode
* Changing UI elements like UIImages programmatically 
* Referring to UI elements using IBOutlets and IBActions
* Detecting user interaction and responding to it appropriately
* Getting familiar with Swift 
* Using Swift variables and arrays to store data 
* Using randomisation in Swift using the random() method
* Creating array of image literals and generating random images from the array of image literals
